Ghostbusters!

If there's something strange in your neighborhood
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
If it's something weird, and it don't look good
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost

If you're seein' things runnin' through your head
Who can you call? (Ghostbusters!)
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Oh, who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

I ain't afraid of no ghost (uh)
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
If you're all alone, pick up the phone
And call (Ghostbusters!)

I ain't afraid of no ghost
I hear it likes the girls
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Mm, if you've had a dose of a freaky ghost, baby
You better call (Ghostbusters!)
Ow!

Let me tell ya somethin'
Bustin' makes me feel good

I ain't afraid of no ghost (uh)
I ain't afraid of no ghost

Don't get caught alone, oh, no
(Ghostbusters!)
When it comes through your door
Unless you just want some more
I think you better call (Ghostbusters!)
Ow!

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Ah, think you better call (Ghostbusters!)
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)

I can't hear you
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Louder (Ghostbusters!)
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
Who can you call? (Ghostbusters!)

Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
